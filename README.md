# Federated-Learning-

This project demonstrates a simple Q-learning algorithm to optimize privacy and accuracy in a hypothetical system. The Q-learning algorithm is used to train an agent to select optimal noise levels to balance privacy and accuracy. The Q-table is updated through episodes to improve the agent's decision-making process over time.

Key Components:
Q-table: Stores the values of state-action pairs, representing the expected future rewards for each action in a given state.
States: Three levels of sensitivity: low_sensitivity, medium_sensitivity, and high_sensitivity.
Actions: Different noise levels ranging from 0.1 to 0.5.
Reward Function: Calculates rewards based on privacy loss and accuracy loss (placeholders for actual computations).

Features:
Q-Learning Algorithm: Uses exploration and exploitation to update the Q-table based on rewards received.
Dynamic Reward Function: Placeholder rewards to simulate privacy and accuracy trade-offs.
Learning Parameters: Includes learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate to guide the learning process.
