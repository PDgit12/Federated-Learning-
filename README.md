# Federated-Learning-
This project demonstrates a simple Q-learning algorithm to optimize privacy and accuracy in a hypothetical system. The Q-learning algorithm is used to train an agent to select optimal noise levels to balance privacy and accuracy. The Q-table is updated through episodes to improve the agent's decision-making process over time.
